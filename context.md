# Project Context

## Repository Information

- **Repository Name**: text_finder

- **Owner**: jonp69

- **Current Branch**: master

## Workspace Structure

The workspace contains the following files:

- `drive_text_searcher.py`: Main file for scanning drives and tracking progress.

- `setup_and_run_text_searcher.bat`: Batch file for setting up and running the text searcher.

## Environment Information

- **Operating System**: Windows

- **Default Shell**: PowerShell

- **Date**: July 22, 2025

## Recent Updates

### Key Changes in `drive_text_searcher.py`

- **Progress Tracking**:
  - Added `drive_max_files` dictionary for per-drive maximum values.
  - Updated `update_progress` to use `drive_max_files` for accurate progress calculation.

- **State Management**:
  - Implemented `save_drive_tracking_state` and `load_drive_tracking_state` methods for saving and restoring drive state.
  - Enhanced `on_progressive_save` to save the complete drive tracking state.
  - Updated `resume_scan` to restore drive tracking state and set per-drive maximums.

- **Dependencies**:
  - Added imports for `string` and `shutil` modules.

### Additional Updates

#### Drive Tracking Enhancements

- Renamed `drive_max_files` to `drive_file_estimates` for clarity.

- Added `drive_estimate_source` to track whether the value is a placeholder or a result of previous counting.

#### Fallback Logic Updates

- Replaced magic numbers (`200000` and `50000`) with global constants `OS_DRIVE_FALLBACK_COUNT` and `BASE_DRIVE_FALLBACK_COUNT`.

- Updated fallback logic to calculate proportional estimates based on the OS drive's used space, falling back to `BASE_DRIVE_FALLBACK_COUNT` only if the calculation fails.

#### Debugging and Tracing

- Added `[TRACE]` logs to key methods for better visibility into the application's execution flow.

- Enhanced logging to separate categories (`debug`, `progress`, `file`) with configurable settings for console and file outputs.

#### Progressive Save Improvements

- Enhanced progressive save logic to include saving the `drive_tracking_state.json` file during auto-saves.

#### User Interaction

- Improved user prompts for handling old cached counts and weighted estimates.

## Pending Tasks

1. Verify the updated methods through testing to ensure all values are saved and restored correctly.

2. Review the save file structure for completeness and consistency.

3. Focus on testing the save/restore functionality and validating progress calculations.

## Notes

- The project uses Python with PySide6 for GUI, threading for parallel operations, and JSON for saving progress.

- Debugging and logging have been enhanced for better visibility into per-drive state.
